# ReactJS-Spring-Boot-Full-Stack-App Project Assignment

Your task is to design and implement a web application using React.js. Use a service like Kinvey or Firebase for your
back-end or create your own with Node.js and MongoDB or a framework in another language (ASP.NET, Spring,
Symfony). It can be a discussion forum, blog system, e-commerce site, online gaming site, social network, or any
other web application of your choice.
1. Application Structure
The application should have:
• Public Part (Accessible without authentication)
• Private Part (Available for Registered Users)
1.1 Public Part
The public part of your projects should be visible without authentication. This public part could be the application
start page, the user login, and user registration forms, as well as the public data of the users, e.g., the blog posts in a
blog system, the public offers in a bid system, the products in an e-commerce system, etc.
1.2 Private Part (User Area)
Registered users should have a personal area in the web application accessible after successful login. This area
could hold for example the user&#39;s profiles management functionality, the user&#39;s offers in a bid system, the user&#39;s
posts in a blog system, the user&#39;s photos in a photo-sharing system, the user&#39;s contacts in a social network, etc.
2. General Requirements
Your Web application should use the following technologies, frameworks, and development techniques:
 At least 3 different dynamic pages (pages like about, contacts, etc. do not count towards that figure)
 Must have specific views:
o Catalog – list of all created records
o Details – information about a specific record
 At least one collection, different from the User collection, with all CRUD operations (create, read, update,
delete)
o Logged in users – create records and request to the REST API, interaction with the records (via
Likes, Dislikes, Comments, etc.)
o Logged in (author) – to be able to Edit / Delete their records
o A Guest should have access to basic website information (catalog, details), but not to the functional
activities

 Use React.js for the client-side
 Communicate to a remote service (via REST, sockets, GraphQL, or a similar client-server technique)
 Implement authentication
 Implement client-side routing
 Demonstrate use of programming concepts, specific to the React library: stateless and state full
components, bound forms, synthetic events, Component Styling, etc.
 Use a source control system, like GitHub
 It is required to have committed in GitHub for at least 3 days

3. Other requirements
 Apply error handling and data validation to avoid crashes when invalid data is entered
 The application should be divided into components with separate CSS files.
 Brief documentation on the project and project architecture (as .md file)
 Demonstrate use of programming concepts - React Hooks, Context API
4. Public Project Defense
Each student will have to deliver a public defense of their work in front of the other students, trainers, and
assistants. Students will have only 20 minutes for the following:
 Demonstrate how the application works (very shortly)
 Show the source code and explain how it works
 Answer questions
Please be strict in the timing! In the 20 th minute, you will be interrupted! It is a good idea to leave the last 5
minutes for questions.
Be well prepared to present the maximum of your work for the minimum amount of time. Open the project assets
beforehand to save time.
5. Bonuses
 Use a state management solution (React Redux) instead of Context API
 Write Unit Tests for your code
 Good UI and UX
 Use a file storage cloud API, e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive, or other for storing the files
 Connect to an external API, like Google Maps, AccuWeather, etc.
 Deploy the application in a cloud (Heroku, Firebase)
 Bonuses depend on the complexity of the implementation
 Anything that is not described in the assignment is a bonus if it has some practical use
6. Assessment Criteria
General Requirements – 50 %
Implementing all the general requirements will grant you a place on the defense schedule. All projects that do not
have the general requirements will not be accepted for defense.
Other Requirements – 20 %
Functionality Presentation – 10 %
Adequately demonstrate the requested functionality. Know your way around the application and quickly
demonstrate the code.
Answering Questions – 20 %
Answer questions about potential functionality outside the scope of the project.
Bonuses – up to 10 %

Additional functionality or libraries outside the general requirements, with motivated usage.
7. Submission Deadline
You must submit your project before 23:59 on 10 Dec using a survey that will show up on 6 Dec. A presentation
schedule will be available on 15 Dec and will include only the projects that were submitted beforehand. Non-
submitted projects will NOT be evaluated.
8. Restrictions
You can use parts (some components, routing configurations, form validation, etc...) of the course workshop, but
you are NOT allowed to use the whole workshop as your project assignment. You are NOT allowed to use HTML &amp;
CSS structures from JS Back-End and JS Applications Courses.
9. Project Challenge
The best three projects will win a discount for the next course or module:
 First place – 80% discount voucher
 Second place – 50% discount voucher
 Third place – 30% discount voucher
The ranking of the projects is done based only on the submitted project (it does not include the assessment of the
theoretical exam). The voucher could be used for one course or one module in the open or the professional
program at SoftUni. It cannot be divided into parts or given to another person. The voucher is valid for one year
after the announcement of the winners.
